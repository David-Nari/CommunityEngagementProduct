# Implement Lit Protocol SDK for Gitcoin GR12 Hackathon

## Create a novel offering for for DAO, NFT Communities, or Creators that use Lit Protocol for gating.


This is your opportunity to get creative and build the first iteration great product or tool for DAOs, NFT Communities, or Creators with social tokens to engage their community. The team at Lit Protocol has already built some tools, like the ability to have token or DAO gated Zoom meetings, Files on GDrive and IPFS, and token gated rooms within Gather.Town.
Some other ideas include connecting Lit Protocol to Twitter posts, connecting Lit Protocol is other dweb networks, and unlockable NFT experiences.
As part of this bounty, you can get creative and build something amazing and novel that enables leaders of crypto based communities to create productivity, fun, and engagement for their community. For example, perhaps you'd like to create a 'game room' for crypto communities to play classic board games with one another or perhaps you'd like to create some kind of DeFi based finance game. This is a very open ended bounty on purpose, so you can get creative with ideas! The offering that you build should use Lit Protocol for ensuring that only members of a given community (based on on-chain conditions) can use parts of the offering you build.
